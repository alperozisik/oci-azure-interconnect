# Revenue Opportunity #2: AI & Analytics Consumption Growth

## Storyboard

A large enterprise leverages both Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to enable advanced analytics and AI capabilities. Data generated by mission-critical applications on Azure is regularly replicated or streamed into OCI, where Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC), or even Oracle's AI/ML services process and analyze the data.

**Note:** In most real-world scenarios, organizations concentrate their AI and analytics workloads primarily on a single platform (in this scenario, Azure), leveraging OCI as the main data source. The Interconnect enables secure, high-speed data transfer from OCI to Azure, supporting incremental migration, data augmentation, and backup analytics as requiredâ€”without duplicating AI/analytics compute across both clouds.

Conversely, some organizations run high-throughput ETL pipelines or data integration jobs from Azure Synapse, Azure Data Factory, or Databricks, pulling data from or pushing data to Oracle databases in OCI. ExpressRoute and FastConnect provide a secure, high-bandwidth, and low-latency backbone for continuous, high-volume data movement between the two clouds. This hybrid setup allows customers to optimize for cost, compliance, or best-in-class analytics/AI tooling.

**Key business outcomes:**
- Increased usage of AI/Analytics platforms on both Azure and OCI
- Greater data movement (thus higher network consumption and cloud storage)
- Improved data-driven insights and operational efficiency
- Opportunity for partners to provide data integration, automation, and analytics services

## Azure & OCI Components

- **Azure:**
  - Azure Synapse Analytics (or Azure Data Factory)
  - Azure Data Lake Storage / Blob Storage
  - ExpressRoute Circuit (Standard or Premium)
  - Virtual Network Gateway

- **OCI:**
  - Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)
  - OCI Object Storage (15TB)
  - FastConnect Circuit
  - Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) & Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)

> *Note: AI/ML and analytics compute workloads are consolidated on Azure. OCI is used primarily as the enterprise data source, supplying data through Interconnect.*
