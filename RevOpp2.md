# Revenue Opportunity #2: AI & Analytics Consumption Growth with Azure-Primary and OCI Augmentation

## Storyboard

A large enterprise leverages both Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to enable advanced analytics and AI capabilities. Data generated by mission-critical applications on Azure is regularly replicated or streamed into OCI, where Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC), or Oracle's AI/ML services process and analyze the data. The Interconnect enables secure, high-speed data transfer between clouds, supporting incremental migration, data augmentation, and backup analytics as required. This architecture can leverage OCI's RDMA-enabled GPU clusters to significantly accelerate AI/ML workloads, removing performance bottlenecks.

The environment also supports production-ready GPU workloads hosted on OCI, enabling enterprises to operationalize AI/ML models at scale without requiring re-platforming.

OCI’s RDMA-enabled GPU clusters deliver up to 3x faster AI/ML training and inference compared to traditional networked GPU setups, complementing Azure’s analytics capabilities with high-performance compute resources.

## Typical Use Cases
- Maintaining core analytics and applications on Azure while augmenting with OCI for high-performance data and AI/ML workloads
- Running hybrid AI/ML training and inference pipelines that leverage OCI GPU clusters alongside Azure analytics
- Secure, low-latency, high-bandwidth data transfer between Azure and OCI for seamless workload orchestration
- Cost and performance optimization by placing workloads on the cloud platform best suited for each task

## Key Business Outcomes
- Expanded usage of AI/Analytics platforms across Azure and OCI in a complementary manner
- Increased data transfer and storage consumption enabled by hybrid cloud integration
- Enhanced data-driven insights through optimized workload placement
- New opportunities for partners to deliver integration, automation, and managed analytics services in a dual-cloud environment

## Azure & OCI Components

- **Azure (Primary Analytics & Application Platform):**
  - Azure Synapse Analytics
  - Azure Data Lake Storage / Blob Storage
  - ExpressRoute Circuit (Standard or Premium)
  - Virtual Network Gateway

- **OCI (Performance Augmentation & AI/ML Acceleration):**
  - Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)
  - OCI Object Storage
  - FastConnect Circuit
  - Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) & Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)
  - OCI GPU Compute Cluster (BM.GPU.A100.8, RDMA-enabled)

> *Note: Azure remains the enterprise’s primary analytics and application platform — no migration or re-platforming required. OCI complements this environment by hosting the data where it performs best, leveraging Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse and RDMA-enabled GPU clusters for high-performance analytics and AI/ML acceleration. Through the Interconnect, data stays synchronized across both clouds, allowing workloads to run in the optimal location: analytics and applications can remain on Azure, while high-intensity data and model training workloads benefit from OCI’s performance and cost efficiency.*
