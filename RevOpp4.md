# Revenue Opportunity #4: Unified Data Management (EBS + OCIâ€“Azure Distributed Data)

## Storyboard

A large enterprise runs its core Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) environment on OCI, taking advantage of high performance, security, and Oracle-native support. At the same time, the organization needs to unify, replicate, and synchronize EBS and other business data across Azure for use with Microsoft analytics, AI, and reporting platforms (such as Power BI or Azure Synapse). Distributed workloads require robust, high-speed, and secure inter-cloud data movement. Azure-OCI Interconnect (ExpressRoute + FastConnect) enables seamless, secure sharing of data between OCI (hosting EBS and Oracle DBs) and Azure (hosting analytics, reporting, or SaaS extensions), supporting multi-cloud data lakes, unified governance, and integrated analytics. The architecture can also extend to multi-region high availability and federated identity management across Azure and OCI, ensuring business continuity and unified access control in distributed environments.

## Typical Use Cases
- Synchronizing EBS master data and transactional data with Azure analytics or reporting services
- Building multi-cloud data lakes and unified BI dashboards
- Integrating custom or SaaS applications in Azure with EBS/Oracle databases in OCI
- Supporting global business continuity, regulatory compliance, or geographic expansion

## Key Business Outcomes
- End-to-end unified data landscape across both clouds
- Real-time or near-real-time analytics, reporting, and AI/ML on business-critical data
- Best-in-class compliance, resilience, and vendor flexibility
- Partner opportunities for integration, migration, and managed services
